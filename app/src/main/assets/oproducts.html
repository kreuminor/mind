   <p><b>MIND Online</b> expands learning and development opportunities through its technology enhanced, web –based, flexible and accessible solutions.</p>  

	This training delivery modality was developed in part against the background of the modernisation goals of the public sector, with particular reference to the Government of Jamaica’s (GoJ’s) technology skill development and utilisation emphasis, to create greater access to training and development opportunities which develop professional competencies and efficiencies.
