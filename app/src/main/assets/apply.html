    In order to be able to apply for courses, you will have to fill out a Participant application form. Filling out this form does not mean that you are automatically enrolled at MIND. This is just another method of applying to the institution.
    <p>
    You will be provided with a username and password and it is important that you retain your username and password as you will need them to apply for future courses without having to re-enter this information. Once received and processed, you will be contacted by a representative of MIND. 
    </p>
    You can apply online via the website, <a href="http://pamm.mind.edu.jm/pam@m/public/register_02_07.cfm">APPLY HERE</a>, for programmes currently being offered.
